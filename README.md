# CH-359 Projects in Computational Chemistry @ EPFL

Supporting scripts, tutorials and materials for CH-359 Projects in Computational Chemistry @ EPFL

# How to approach this repository

This is the private version, with all the answers and comments. #todo: create a public version

It is divided by week, and inside each folder there will be an explanation on how to install the required packages, scritps to run (tutorials and exercises) and a commented solution.

# Plan 2023-1

| Week  | Topic                    | Specifics     | Ideas          |
| :---  | :---                     | :---          | :---           |     
| 1     | How is my MOF doing?     | Get familiar with mofchecker, oximachine, manage_crystal, visualization, geometric features    | For cleaning, as exercise: PCN-223 - partial occupations; manually create lone molecules               |
| 2     | Looking for convergence  | Write inputs, perform sp with different cutoff, rel_cutoff, with and without supercell      | Use MOF-5               |
| 3	    | Looking for ground state | Write inputs, perform geo_opt and cell_opt and work on what's left from 1 |	|
| 4	    | Testing different flavors| Write inputs for different functionals: PBE0, DFT+U, SCAN, xTB?	| **test before if it works! |
| 5	    | Analyzing results	       | Plot density of states, analyze orbitals, and start with presentation	| Talk about fundamental vs optical gap; give them data on GW, BSE, TDDFT, experimental optical gap |
